/**
 * For Advisors page content.
 *
 * Alternative-landing review (plan v2 §5): removed the capabilities the
 * advisor script describes but nobody has confirmed for launch (coordination
 * tools across households, co-branded materials, client reporting) and the
 * outcome promise "Fewer inbound calls"; the practice-fit section went with
 * them. "Your client chooses what you see" became who takes part (no
 * per-category permissions). No prices anywhere.
 *
 * Source: `kinage-site (1).html` → the #/advisors route (`#page-advisors`),
 * in its order. Copy is the source's, verbatim, with the site's rules
 * applied: headings lose their trailing period, and the source's primary
 * action ("Join the advisor network") uses this site's advisor CTA, "Partner
 * with Kinage", which opens the contact dialog in partnership mode. Left out
 * on purpose: the source's review banner ("Mockup for review…") and its film
 * placeholder ("Film E, the advisor film") — there is no advisor film asset.
