/**
 * Our Story page content.
 *
 * Source: `kinage-site (1).html` → #page-story. That page is a writing
 * template, not copy ("Template, not copy … Nothing here invents his
 * history"): it defines the headings and what each chapter should say, and
 * leaves every narrative block as a prompt for Ben. Only facts that already
 * exist in approved copy are published here:
 *
 *  - Ben's own paragraph and heading from the landing's founder section
 *    (Figma 583:787);
 *  - the product constraints the template names for "What we refused to
 *    build", in the wording already approved on the landing (trust section,
 *    583:870; What Kinage Is, 583:595).
 *
 * The other chapters keep their template heading and brief with `copy: null`
 * and are not rendered until Ben writes them — drop his paragraphs into
 * `copy` and the page picks them up. Nothing below is invented history.
